# BuggyAPI Project Fixes and Improvements

## 1. Initial Assessment
- Opened the project and identified that the structure was disorganized.
- Noticed the absence of a `.csproj` file and the missing `Startup.cs`.
- Observed that the `Program.cs` was configured to use `Startup.cs`, which did not exist.
- Identified tightly coupled business logic within the controller.
- Detected performance issues in the `GetAllShipments` method due to lack of pagination.
- Noted that the `Status` property was a plain string without validation.
- All types of errors were returning 500 Internal Server Error due to the absence of proper error handling.


## 2. Project Setup and Configuration
- **Created `BuggyAPI.csproj`:** Added a project file with essential dependencies:
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`
  - `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` for API documentation
- **Created `Startup.cs`:** Implemented Dependency Injection (DI) and registered services.
- **Moved Connection String:** Transferred the connection string to `appsettings.json` for security.

## 3. Code Refactoring and Improvements
- **Service Layer Implementation:**
  - Created `IShipmentService` interface and `ShipmentService` class.
  - Moved business logic from `ShipmentsController` to the service layer.
- **Pagination:**
  - Implemented pagination in `GetAllShipments` to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Async Operations:**
  - Converted all database operations to `async/await` to improve scalability.
- **Enum for Status:**
  - Introduced `ShipmentStatus` enum (`Pending`, `Shipped`, `Delivered`, `Cancelled`).
  - Updated `UpdateShipmentStatusAsync` to validate status input using `Enum.TryParse`.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Added proper `NotFound()` responses when records are not found.
  - Note: Only basic error handling was implemented; not all cases are covered.

## 4. Testing and Verification
- Verified that the project builds successfully without errors.
- Tested API endpoints to confirm correct functionality:
  - Pagination works as expected.
  - Status updates validate against the enum.

## 5. Future Improvements
- **Logging:**
  - Implement application-wide logging for actions and errors.
  - Integrate logging tools (e.g., Serilog, NLog) to capture and store logs.
- **Enhanced Validation:**
  - Add more comprehensive input validation across all endpoints.
  - Implement data annotations and custom validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- **Global Exception Handling:**
  - Introduce middleware for centralized exception handling to manage unhandled errors gracefully.
- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Implement authentication and authorization to secure the API.
  - Apply data protection, input sanitization, and rate limiting for improved security.

## 6. Final Status
- Project is fully functional, optimized, and follows clean architecture practices
